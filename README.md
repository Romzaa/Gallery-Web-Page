This is a Gallery WEB PAGE Created as an application project for Front-End practices. <br>
It was Created with HTML, Bootstrap, JavaScrtipt and little internal inline CSS <br>
<br>
Practicing applying Bootsrtap only was intended to be able to work reliable with it . <br>
Also JavaScript applications are in first steps so I just added two buttons ( Dark-Mode & Light-Mode ) <br>
The Web Page is responsive to size changes and variable displays. <br>

All the material are for learning purposes only.
